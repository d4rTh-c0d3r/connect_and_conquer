Hi! This project was done for the course CS 152 (Abstractions and Paradigms for Programming) during the second semester. We have implemented the classic game of Connect-The-Dots, which I'm pretty sure we all must have played during our childhood. We used the functional programming paradigm to develop the game using Racket language. For more details, refer the report. To run the game, open the "Connect N Conquer" folder and then open "Connect N Conquer.rkt" in Dr. Racket, which is an interpreter for the language. Just type (connect-the-dots) (with brackets) in the console and hit enter. You should see a GUI interface right away. Please make sure to read the Report before starting. Thanks!
